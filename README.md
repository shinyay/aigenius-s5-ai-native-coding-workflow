# AI Genius Episode 1: Workshop Repo

![TitlePage](./assets/AI-Genius-Ep1.png)


## "Code with AI: GitHub Copilot for AI-Native Coding Workflows"

Welcome! This is the hands-on workshop repo for **AI Genius Episode 1**. You'll work through the full AI-native development loop: writing issues, delegating to Copilot, reviewing generated code, and iterating via PR comments.

---

## What You Will Learn

- What "AI Native" actually means for developers
- How to write issues that give Copilot the context it needs
- How to assign work to Copilot and observe it in action
- How to review Copilot-generated PRs like a senior developer
- How to iterate via PR comments instead of starting from scratch
- Best practices for collaborating with AI throughout the coding process

---

## The AI-Native Workflow Loop

```
IDEA
  └─► GitHub Issue  (describe the work)
        └─► Assign to Copilot  (Copilot agent picks it up)
              └─► Code is generated in a secure sandbox
                    └─► Draft PR is opened  (with session log)
                          └─► Human reviews and iterates via PR comments
                                └─► Merge and ship
```

You are the **tech lead** in this workflow. Copilot handles the *how*. You define the *what* and *why*.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with access to GitHub Copilot
- [GitHub Copilot App](https://github.com/features/copilot) installed (desktop)
- Python 3.10+ installed locally (for the starter app)
- Git installed

### Get Started

1. **Fork this repo** to your own GitHub account (top-right corner of this page).

2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AIGenius-GHCP-AINative.git
   cd AIGenius-GHCP-AINative
   ```

3. **Run the starter app**:
   ```bash
   cd starter-app
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py add "Deploy the API" --priority high --due 2025-12-31 --tag work
   python app.py add "Buy coffee" --priority low --tag personal
   python app.py list
   python app.py stats
   ```

4. **Open the GitHub Copilot App** and connect it to your forked repo.

5. Work through the exercises in order, starting with [`exercises/01-write-an-issue`](./exercises/01-write-an-issue/README.md).

## The 5 Golden Rules of AI-Native Coding

1. **Write better issues** -- your issue IS your prompt. Be specific.
2. **Review like a senior dev** -- AI generates fast, humans verify smart.
3. **Use `copilot-instructions.md`** -- give Copilot standing context about your project.
4. **Iterate, don't regenerate** -- guide via comments rather than starting from scratch.
5. **Stay in the loop** -- check the session log, understand what Copilot did and why.
